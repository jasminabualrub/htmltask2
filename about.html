    <h1>Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC)</h1>
  <p>is an American fast food restaurant chain headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, that specializes in fried chicken.<br>
     It is the world's second-largest restaurant chain (as measured by sales) after McDonald's, with 22,621 locations globally in 150 countries as of December 2019.<br>
      The chain is a subsidiary of Yum! Brands, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains.<br>

    KFC was founded by Colonel Harland Sanders (1890â€“1980), an entrepreneur who began selling fried chicken from his roadside restaurant in Corbin, Kentucky, during the Great Depression.<br>
     Sanders identified the potential of the restaurant franchising concept and the first "Kentucky Fried Chicken" franchise opened in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1952. <br>
     KFC popularized chicken in the fast-food industry, diversifying the market by challenging the established dominance of the hamburger.
